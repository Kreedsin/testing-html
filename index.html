    <h1>About me!</h1>
    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>My name is Lee, I am 30 years old and since I was a young boy and my father took me into the city I realised I didn't like it and I'd rather sit at home on the computer all day, thus I ended up becoming a gamer, starting with games such as diablo 1 and age of empires and the original warcraft games, this led me down a blizzard games path.</p>
    <h2>My skills:</h2>
    <p>Aim god, very snappy aim <br>
        Fastish typer, like playing type racing games <br>
        Cat collector, I have 5 <br>
        I can solve a rubix cube quite fast.

    <h3>Japan!</h3>
    <p>I would love to visit Japan, not only for it's incredible atmosphere and nightlife, and the gaming themed culture around it, but also the beautiful nature the country has to offer!<br>
    If I was to go to Japan I would love to travel around it, experience the food, night life, capsual hotels and go see some of the nature!<br>
    I plan to go there some time in the future!
